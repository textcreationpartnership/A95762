            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Now in regard that above-ſaid <hi>Article</hi> of <hi>the Church of Ireland,</hi> confirmed by the <hi>judgement</hi> of the late <hi>Primate,</hi> hath been ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt by Doctor <hi>Heylene</hi>
                  <pb n="147" facs="tcp:170368:82"/> for that (as he ſaith) there is <hi>no ſuch doctrine in the book of Arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, nor in any publick monument, or record of the Church of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, but the contrary rather.</hi> I ſhall cite ſome paſſages out of the book of <hi>Homilies,</hi> which are ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by the book of <hi>Articles,</hi> as a larger declaration of the <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and leave it to the <hi>Readers</hi> judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>In the third part of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon of good works, ſpeaking againſt the Popiſh ſinging of <hi>Trentals,</hi> and the <hi>ſuperſtitious</hi> Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders in the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to ſerve the Papacy, theſe words are as followeth: viz. <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour be to God, who did put light in the heart of King</hi> Henry <hi>the eighth; to put away all ſuch ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitions, and Phariſaical Sects, by
<pb n="148" facs="tcp:170368:83"/> Antichriſt invented,</hi> &amp;c. which can be meant of no other, but the <hi>See of Rome;</hi> by the words not long after. viz. <hi>Let us rehearſe ſome other kinds of Papiſtical ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtitions, &amp;c.</hi> In the ſecond part of the Sermon of ſalvation, ſpeaking againſt the <hi>Popiſh opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of juſtification by works;</hi> theſe words are as followeth. <hi>Juſtification is not the office of man, but of God; for man cannot make himſelf righteous by his own works, neither in part, nor in the whole, for that were the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt arrogancy</hi> and <hi>preſumption</hi> of man, that <hi>Antichriſt</hi> could ſet up againſt God, etc. and ſo accounts it not the doctrine of a <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> that ſets forth <hi>Chriſts glory,</hi> but of him that is an <hi>adverſary</hi> to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and his Goſpel; and a ſetter forth of <hi>mans vain-glory,</hi> &amp;c..
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:170368:83"/> And that paſſage in the third part of the Sermon againſt the <hi>perill of Idolatry,</hi> p. 69. I leave to the Readers judgement, if the ſenſe can be underſtood, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe then of the <hi>See of Rome,</hi> in theſe words following. viz. <hi>Now concerning (popiſh) exceſſive deck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Images and Idols, with paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, gilding, adorning with preti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous veſtures, pearles and ſtones, what is it elſe but for the further provocation and inticement to ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual fornication; whieh the Ido<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latrous Church, underſtandeth well enough. For ſhe being indeed, not only an harlot (as the Scripture calls her) but alſo a foule, filthy, old harlot (for ſhe is indeed of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient yeares) and underſtanding her lack of nature and true beauty, and great lothſomneſſe, which of her ſelf ſhe hath; ſhe doth (after
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:170368:84"/> the cuſtome of ſuch harlots) paint her ſelf, and deck and tire her ſelf with gold, pearle, ſtone, and all kind of pretious jewels, that ſhe ſhining with the outward beauty and glory of them, may pleaſe the fooliſh fantaſie of fond lovers, and ſo entice them to ſpiritual forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation with her. Who if they ſaw her (I will not ſay naked) but in ſimple apparel, would abhorre her, as the fouleſt, and filthieſt harlot that ever was ſeen; According as appeareth by the deſcription of the garniſhing of the great ſtrumpet of all ſtrumpets, the Mother of whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>domes, ſet forth by Saint John in his Revelation</hi> (Apoc. 17.) <hi>who by her glory provoked the Princes of the earth, to commit whoredome with her,</hi> &amp;c. and it followeth, pag. 77. <hi>And it is not enough to deck Idols, but at the laſt, come in
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:170368:84"/> the Prieſts themſelves likewiſe decked with gold and pearle, and with a ſolemn pace, they paſs forth before theſe golden puppets, and fall down to the ground on their marrow-bones before theſe honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Idols, and then riſing up again, offer up odours and incenſe to them:</hi> &amp;c. He that reads the whole, cannot judge of it to be meant otherwiſe, then of the <hi>Papacy.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And if the <hi>fifth and ſixth part of the Sermon againſt wilful rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion</hi> be viewed, there will be found ſuch a large narration of the pride and ambition of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop of <hi>Rome,</hi> that there will not need any further help to an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of that 2 Theſ. 2. to him, which thus beginneth, viz. <hi>After that ambition and deſire of domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, entred once into Eccleſiaſtical Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters,
<pb n="152" facs="tcp:170368:85"/> whoſe greatneſſe (after the doctrine and the example of our Saviour) ſhould chiefly ſtand in humbling themſelves; And that the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>did by intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable ambition challenge, not only to be the head of all the Church diſperſed throughout the world, but alſo to be Lord of all kingdoms of the world, as is expreſſely ſet forth in the book of his own Canon-Lawes. He became at once the ſpoyler and deſtroyer both of the Church, which is the kingdom of our Saviour Chriſt, and of the Chriſtian Empire, and all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an kingdomes, as an univerſal Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant over all.</hi> The particulars of whoſe actions to that end, are there related. viz. <hi>The Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>ſtirring up ſubjects to rebell againſt their Soveraigne Lords, even the Son againſt the Father,
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:170368:85"/> pronouncing ſuch Schiſmaticks, and perſecuting them, who refuſed to acknowledge his above-ſaid challenge of ſupreme authority over them; diſcharging them from their oath of fidelity made not only to the Emperour, but to other Kings and Princes throughout Chriſtendome. The moſt cruell and bloody wars raiſed amongſt Chriſtian Princes of all kingdoms: the horrible murder of infinite thouſands of Chriſtian men, being ſlain by Chriſtians, the loſſe of ſo many great Cities, Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, Dominions, and Kingdomes, ſometimes poſſeſſed by Chriſtians in Aſia, Affrick, and Europe; The miſerable fall of the Empire, and Church of Greece, ſometime the moſt flouriſhing part of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, into the hands of the Turks; The lamentable diminiſhing, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cay and ruine of Chriſtian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion:
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:170368:86"/> and all by the practice and procurement of the Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>chiefly, which is in the Hiſtories and Chronicles written by the Biſhop of</hi> Rome<hi>'s own fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourites and friends to be ſeen, claiming alſo to have divers Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and Kings to their vaſſals, liege men, and ſubjects, &amp;c. beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving themſelves more like Kings and Emperours in all things, then remained like Prieſts, Biſhops and Eccleſiaſtical;</hi> or, (as they would be called) <hi>ſpiritual perſons in any one thing at all,</hi> &amp;c. and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes with an exhortation of all good ſubjects, <hi>knowing thoſe the ſpeciall inſtruments of the Devill, to the ſtirring up of all Rebellion, to avoid and flee them.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Is not this a full deſcription of the pride of <hi>that man of ſinne.</hi> 2 Theſſ. 2. in <hi>exalting himſelfe
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:170368:86"/> above all Kings and Princes,</hi> and that <hi>ſon of perdition</hi> (being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood <hi>actively:</hi>) who was the cauſe of the <hi>perdition,</hi> or loſſe of ſo many thouſands of Chriſtian mens lives.</p>
               <p>And in the <hi>ſixth part of the ſame Sermon,</hi> you have a more particular relation of the <hi>Biſhop of</hi> Rome<hi>'s blood-ſhed,</hi> (according to the deſcription of that Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lot, Revel. 17.6.) in theſe words. viz. <hi>And as theſe ambitious uſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers the Biſhops of</hi> Rome, <hi>have overflowed all</hi> Italy <hi>and</hi> Germa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny <hi>with ſtreams of Chriſtian blood, ſhed by the rebellions of ignorant ſubjects againſt their naturall Lords and Emperours, whom they have ſtirred thereunto by falſe pretences: ſo is there no Countrey in Chriſtendome, which by the like means of falſe pretences, hath not
<pb n="156" facs="tcp:170368:87"/> been over-ſprinkled with the blood of ſubjects, by rebellion againſt their naturall Soveraigns, ſtirred up by the ſame Biſhops of</hi> Rome, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in concluſion, as the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon often entitles the Biſhops of Rome, <hi>unſatiable wolfes,</hi> and their Adherents, <hi>Romiſh greedy wolfes;</hi> ſo doth it in ſpeciall call <hi>the See of</hi> Rome, the <hi>Babyloni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>call beaſt, in theſe words;</hi> viz. <hi>The Biſhop of</hi> Rome <hi>underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the bruit blindneſſe, ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and ſuperſtition of the Engliſh in King</hi> Johns <hi>time,</hi> and how much they were inclined <hi>to worſhip the Babilonical beaſt of Rome, and to fear all his threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and cauſeleſſe curſes, he abuſed them thus,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>I have tranſcribed theſe the more largely out of the Book of <hi>Homilies,</hi> both that ſuch as have
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:170368:87"/> rejected them as <hi>Popiſh</hi> may ſee their errour, and thoſe that now ſo much favour the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> that they call ſuch language <hi>rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling,</hi> may have their <hi>mouthes ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped,</hi> being it is from the <hi>mouth</hi> of <hi>the Church of England</hi> in her Homilies, which is a good war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant for her <hi>ſons</hi> to ſay after her.</p>
               <p>Let the Reader judge whether theſe paſſages do not confirme, rather then contradict, or <hi>be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary</hi> (as Doctor <hi>Heylene</hi> ſaith) to the <hi>Articles of Ireland,</hi> and the <hi>Primates</hi> judgement of the <hi>See of Rome.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall only alledge one paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage more, and that is in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion of the ſecond part of <hi>the Sermon for Whit-ſunday.</hi> viz. <hi>Wicked and nought were the Popes and Prelates of</hi> Rome <hi>for the moſt part, as doth well appear by the
<pb n="158" facs="tcp:170368:88"/> ſtory of their lives, and therefore worthily accounted among the number of falſe Prophets, and falſe Chriſts, which deceived the world a long while, the Lord de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend us from their Tyranny and pride, that they may never enter into this Vineyard again; but that they may be utterly confounded, and put to flight in all parts of the world. And he of his great mercy ſo work,</hi> that the Goſpel of his Son may be truly preached to the beating down of <hi>ſin, death, the Pope, the Devill, and all the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of Antichriſt,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This latter paſſage is only pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by Doctor <hi>Heylene,</hi> as an evidence, that the <hi>Pope</hi> is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> either <hi>here,</hi> or <hi>any where elſe,</hi> in the book of Articles or Homilies, which how the force of it can be
<pb n="159" facs="tcp:170368:88"/> extended ſo farre beyond its <hi>own ſphere,</hi> doth not appeare: For his principal argument, that he finds here the <hi>Pope and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, diſtinguiſhed as much as the Devil and the Pope.</hi> 'Tis <hi>anſwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red,</hi> The deſtinction here is not between the Pope and Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſt, but between him and <hi>his Antichriſtian kingdom;</hi> for the words are not, the Pope, the Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vell, and <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> but, <hi>and all the kingdome of Antichriſt.</hi> That Univerſality <hi>(all)</hi> comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both head and members. And if we ſhould allow a <hi>Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umvirate,</hi> (in the <hi>Pope</hi> and <hi>Devill</hi>) for the government of that king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, one as the <hi>viſible</hi> head, the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as the <hi>inviſible,</hi> or the one him that <hi>reigneth;</hi> the other <hi>by whom he receiveth power ſo to do:</hi> (Rev. 13.4.) both might be thus owned
<pb n="160" facs="tcp:170368:89"/> without infringing the title of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Howſoever 'tis not the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings from ſuch <hi>niceties</hi> in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing of words (which the book of <hi>Homilies,</hi> are not ſtrict in, as might be ſhewed in ſeveral inſtances) but the obſervation of the <hi>ſcope</hi> and drift of the place, the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring</hi> it with others, the <hi>concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance</hi> of the judgement of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall eminent <hi>Biſhops</hi> afore-cited, (who cannot be imagined to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare againſt the doctrine of it) will carry the ſenſe of it accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly, with the <hi>judicious</hi> and <hi>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>biaſſed</hi> Reader: and ſo much for the book of <hi>Homilies.</hi>

               <p>The firſt is, <hi>Confirmation</hi> of children after Baptiſme, which hath ſomewhat of <hi>Antiquity</hi> for it, moſt of the Writers of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> incline that way, and even <hi>Calvin</hi> is of that mind alſo, and in his Comment upon this place, ſtands much for it, and wiſheth it had not been laid aſide; <hi>hodie retinenda pura inſtitutio, ſuperſtitio autem corri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genda;</hi> and produceth this cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome of confirming of children in the Primitive times, to be an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument
<pb n="178" facs="tcp:170368:98"/> they were then <hi>baptized,</hi> but I conceive it cannot be the ſence, for this reaſon; becauſe 'tis not a <hi>Fundamentall,</hi> and hard to prove, it was then (like <hi>Baptiſme</hi> and the reſt) eſteemed to be of a neceſſary uſe and belief in the <hi>Catholick</hi> Church, according to that of <hi>Vincentius Lyrinenſis,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Magnopere cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum eſt ut id teneamus, quod ubique, quod ſemper, quod ab omnibus creditum eſt, hoc eſt enim verè &amp; propriè Catholicum. contr. haereſin. cap. <hi>3.</hi>
                  </note> 
                  <hi>That is, to be held for a Catholick ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, which hath been believed eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry where, alwayes, and by all;</hi> And our Church ſaith, <hi>children bapti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zed, have all things neceſſary to their ſalvation;</hi> The Papiſts that hold it to be a <hi>Sacrament,</hi> do not ſay 'tis a <hi>Fundamentall,</hi> and when it was obſerved by us, we took it to be only an ancient laudable <hi>cuſtome</hi> of the Church, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it was ſo in Saint <hi>Pauls</hi> time, in the Church of the Hebrewes, it doth not appear.</p>
               <pb n="179" facs="tcp:170368:98"/>
               <p>The ſecond Expoſition is, that it ſhould be meant <hi>an ordained Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtery,</hi> which clearly in Saint <hi>Paul</hi>'s time we find was wont to be by <hi>laying on of hands.</hi> This is <hi>Pareus</hi> his ſenſe upon this place.

<pb n="182" facs="tcp:170368:100"/> called laying on of hands from the outward rite; as the Lords Supper, by breaking of bread; And this was the judgement</hi> of the moſt Reverend and learned <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther</hi> of our Church, the late <hi>Arch-Biſhop of Armagh,</hi> which hath the rather emboldned me to employ my thoughts in the confirmation of it; and ſurely, if it be a <hi>funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentall,</hi> the knowledge of the ſenſe of it, is of a greater conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, then to be <hi>ſlighted.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Now if Ordination be a fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damental principle, hence then theſe 2 things may be inferred.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>A neceſſity of continuing an ordained Miniſtery in the Church,
<pb n="189" facs="tcp:170368:103"/> and the neglect of it to be the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derming of the foundation of it.</hi>

               <p n="2">2. That <hi>Ordination is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an internal call from God, but an externall from Man;</hi> for 'tis denominated here from <hi>laying on of hands.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Firſt <hi>a neceſſity</hi> of continuing ſuch a diſtinct Order and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion for preaching, and other ſacred Adminiſtrations; This ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject would heretofore have been accounted <hi>needleſſe</hi> to be hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, but it is neceſſary and <hi>ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable</hi> now, there being many ſet againſt the very <hi>function,</hi> as if any man might of himſelf aſſume it. To ſuch I ſhall repreſent theſe conſiderations following. <hi>viz.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That in all ages there have been ſome perſons ſet apart for ſuch divine Offices even <hi>before the Law,</hi> or conſtitution of <hi>Aa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron</hi>

A ſpeech to the Prieſts, and for that five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred-yeer gap betwixt the Old Teſtament and the New, when the <hi>Prophets</hi> ceaſed, yet a <hi>Prieſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood</hi> continued, that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice
<pb n="191" facs="tcp:170368:104"/> of God, then was not to put to the charity of Paſſengers, as beggars are by the high way, but ſome were appropriated to it; <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roboam</hi> that forſook the <hi>Temple,</hi> yet retained a <hi>Prieſthood,</hi> though of his own corrupt appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
               <p>Object. <hi>That of the Law was a</hi> Prieſthood, <hi>but we ſpeak of a</hi> Miniſtery.</p>
               <p>

                  <hi>Reſp.</hi> 1. We ſtand not upon words or Titles; neither doth the Apoſtle, for as (2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.7, 8, 9.) he calls the Prieſts of the Law <hi>Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters,</hi> and their office a Miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo he implies, that the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of the Goſpel might have that Title of <hi>Prieſts</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9.13.) by taking his Argument for their maintenance from the Prieſts, Altar, and Temple, as <hi>they that ſerve at the Altar, partake of the
<pb n="192" facs="tcp:170368:105"/> Altar; even ſo hath God ordained, that thoſe that preach the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel, ſhould live of the Goſpel;</hi> and the name hath only grown igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minious, by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>'s retaining it, whom if by way of diſtinction, they had been called by us <hi>ſacrificers</hi> (as Biſhop <hi>Downham</hi> obſerves) there had been no offence in it. All that read the <hi>Fathers,</hi> know it is the term uſed by them; whoſe Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctates of the Miniſtery are inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled <hi>De Sacerdotio.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And the Apoſtle makes it on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly <hi>a change of the Prieſthood, (Hebr.</hi> 7.12.) not a <hi>nulling</hi> of it, upon which change of a miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, none preſumed of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to officiate without an <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination; John Baptiſt</hi> who was the preparative voice of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpel was ordained to it, and his
<pb n="193" facs="tcp:170368:105"/> diſciples were <hi>ſet apart</hi> by him; our Saviour did the like in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining firſt Twelve for preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and baptizing, and then 72 after them, when one of the twelve was loſt, no other ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped into his place without a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemne choice of him; <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, Acts</hi> 14.23. whereſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they came and converted any nation, were carefull of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining Succeſſors. Saint <hi>Paul,</hi> as his laſt, gives that charge to <hi>Timo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy</hi> and <hi>Titus</hi> after him, and in all Ages of the Church from the Primitive times, both in the Greek and Latine Church, it hath been obſerved to this day ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively.</p>
               <p>So that for ſuch as would have no ſuch office of a Miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry by ordination, but all men left to themſelves to officiate at their
<pb n="194" facs="tcp:170368:106"/> pleaſure, we may ſay with the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.16.) <hi>We have had no ſuch cuſtome, neither the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches of God,</hi> (or as <hi>Eliphaz</hi> to <hi>Job cap.</hi> 5.1.) <hi>call now if there be any will anſwer thee, and to which of the Saints wilt thou turn,</hi> where is there any ſuch Preſident in all the reformed Churches? The <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites</hi> would have a <hi>King as all other nations;</hi> Theſe are upon the contrary ſingularity. 'Tis true, the <hi>New Jeruſalem (Revel.</hi> 21.22. meant <hi>heaven,</hi> is found without a Temple and a Prieſt, becauſe Chriſt ſhall then <hi>give up his kingdome to his Father</hi> (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.) i. e. the manner of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent government by the <hi>Scepter</hi> of his word, and <hi>Seale</hi> of Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and then <hi>God ſhall be all in all,</hi> but till then, a ſetled Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery muſt be continued.</p>
               <pb n="195" facs="tcp:170368:106"/>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="2"/> Secondly, if no ſucceſſive or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dainedMiniſtery, why doth Saint <hi>Paul</hi> ſpend ſo much time in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horting to a <hi>future proviſion</hi> for them. (1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 9. <hi>Gal.</hi> 6.6. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 5.17.) can we think it was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for himſelf, and ſuch then li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, who expected <hi>Martyrdome</hi> weekly; why ſuch large directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for the <hi>qualification</hi> of ſuch, as were to be ordained by his Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, in his Epiſtles to <hi>Timothy,</hi> and <hi>Titus,</hi> ſurely it was written for our inſtruction now.</p>
               <p>
                  <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="3"/> Thirdly, conſider what <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion</hi> muſt be the iſſue of the contrary, our <hi>Saviour</hi> pitied the people, when they were like <hi>Sheep without a Shepherd;</hi> That which is every mans work, is no bodies: As in reaſon, the office of the Miniſtery muſt be <hi>weakly</hi> and negligently done, when no
<pb n="196" facs="tcp:170368:107"/> perſons are appointed to make it their ſtudy and labour, ſo when <hi>gaps</hi> are thus opened for any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, may not <hi>Jeſuits</hi> and ſuch lik Agents creep in under other forms, and <hi>privily bring in dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable hereſies,</hi> to the ſeducing of the hearers; I am loth to imagine that this ſhould be at the <hi>bottome</hi> of this aſſertion, that ſo with the more ſpecious pretext, they might take away the mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, as indeed one muſt fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the other; for if there be no need of a <hi>ſetled ordained</hi> Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery, what uſe of a <hi>ſetled meanes</hi> alotted for it.</p>
               <p>If any ſhall ſtumble at that ſpeech often in the mouthes of ſome, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 54.13. <hi>All thy chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſhall be taugbt of the Lord,</hi> he may be ſatisfied by this double Anſwer.</p>

                  <pb n="197" facs="tcp:170368:107"/>1. It was fulfilled in that time of our Lord and Saviour, teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them immediately by himſelf, which he expounds accordingly; (<hi>John</hi> 6.45.) <hi>It is written in the Prophets, they ſhall be all taught of God, every man therefore that hath learned of the Father, cometh unto me, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. The Lord is ſaid to teach, when he doth it by a Miniſtery, ſent by him according to that of <hi>Jerem.</hi> 3.15. <hi>I will give you Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtors after my own heart, that ſhall feed you with knowledge and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, &amp;c.</hi> fulfilled under the Goſpel. And we grant, that though the propoſal of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine is by the Miniſter, yet the illumination of the mind, and the rectifying of the heart through it, is from God.</p>
               <p>

               <p>And thus in theſe four things, I leave it to be calmly conſidered of, if the Miniſters have not power left them by Chriſt in relation to <hi>forgiveneſſe</hi> of ſins, and with theſe limitations, whether that part of <hi>the old form</hi> of the words of <hi>Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination,</hi> might not be continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed alſo, which ſeems to me to be explained in the next following them; viz. <hi>And be thou a faithfull diſpenſer of the word, and Sacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, &amp;c.</hi> (through both which the graces of the Holy Ghoſt,
<pb n="276" facs="tcp:170368:147"/> and remiſſion of ſins are convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſealed) <hi>in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> According as in the words at the Communion uſed to the <hi>recipient,</hi> the former clauſe was added <hi>in Q.

<pb n="179" facs="tcp:170368:148"/> conſcience, but requireth further Councell and Comfort, then let him come to me; or ſome other diſcreet, and learned Miniſter of Gods word, and open his grief, that he may receive ſuch Ghoſtly Councel, Advice, and Comfort; as his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience may be relieved; and that by the Miniſtery of Gods word, he may receive comfort, and the benefit of abſolution, to the quiet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his conſcience, and avoyd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of all ſcruple, and doubtful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe.</hi>

               <p>And now let the Reader judge if Dr. <hi>Heylene</hi> hath not cauſe to repent of his raſh cenſure of the Primate, (in his late book p. 108.) as if in this part of his Anſwer to the Jeſuite, he had (as he ſaith) <hi>in this particular, utterly ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as well the doctrine of this Church, as her purpoſe in it, &amp;c.</hi>

<pb n="281" facs="tcp:170368:149"/> aſſure the ſoule of the penitent, that he is pardoned of God, which no other man or Angel can do, <hi>ex officio,</hi> but the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter of Chriſt, according to that of the Apoſtle; <hi>To us is commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the word of reconciliation,</hi> this is the ſumme of the Primates judgement.

               <p>Now for the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> yee have a Preſident for it; (which is above all Preſidents) in our <hi>bleſſed Saviour,</hi> who gave a form to his diſciples, (<hi>Luke</hi> 11, 1.) <hi>When ye pray, ſay,</hi> not only (as <hi>Matthew</hi> 6.) ſay <hi>after this manner,</hi> or ſay <hi>thus;</hi> but ſay this.

A good example for us to follow, not to ayme at a <hi>Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularity,</hi> or a diviſion between other Churches, and us, but to draw as near as we can to a <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction</hi> with them, in having one <hi>heart,</hi> and one <hi>tongue.</hi> Seek not wayes never before thought of, but tread in the ſteps of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent

               </p>
               <p>And the Reconciling of the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> is eaſie, <hi>viz.</hi> It was our Saviours mind, that it ſhould be both a <hi>rule</hi> for all other, and <hi>ſaid for a prayer</hi> alſo, and that which is a rule for others, muſt needs be in the higheſt degree ſo it ſelfe. A <hi>Standerd</hi> for any meaſure, dry or liquid, may be uſed for that meaſure too; and ſo 'tis no contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, that the <hi>Lords prayer</hi> ſhould be as the <hi>meaſure</hi> for other prayers, and ſaid for a prayer alſo.</p>
               <p>And that it was ſo underſtood by the Fathers in the Primitive times; I ſhall onely repreſent unto you ſome of the words of Saint <hi>Cyprian</hi> in <hi>his Sermon</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it, who lived about 250. years after our Saviour: and died a
<pb n="301" facs="tcp:170368:159"/> Martyr. He exhorts the people <hi>not to omit the uſe of the Lords prayer with their other prayers,</hi> in which he hath ſome ſuch ſpeeches as theſe, ſurely thou art more likely to obtein thy requeſt; <hi>cum qui habitat intus in pectore, ipſe ſit in voce,</hi> when he that is in thy heart, is alſo in thy tongue: <hi>How can God but hear thee, when thou comeſt in the words of his Sonne, takes up the prayer ſanctified by his ſacred mouth; If thou haſt no other prayer, uſe this; if thou haſt others, uſe this alſo, and urge God daily in his own language; and with the words of his beloved Son.

I ſpeak not of prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Sermon</hi> and after, (when each may take their liberty, though therein the <hi>Dutch and French</hi> Church are ſtrict alſo) but of ſome <hi>conſent</hi> in the manner of <hi>Adminiſtration of Baptiſme, the communion,</hi> and other offices in the publick, that might be own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by us all in <hi>Common,</hi> as the form of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> which as it hath been a means to continue a <hi>unity</hi> in <hi>other reformed Churches</hi> at this day; ſo I believe would be a means for the redu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing it with us, even a ſetled peace both in <hi>Church and State;</hi> which ought to be the prayer and <hi>principall</hi> endeavour of every
<pb n="316" facs="tcp:170368:167"/> good Chriſtian. So much for the declaring and confirming the <hi>Primates Judgment</hi> of the uſe of a ſet form of prayer in the <hi>pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now unto his, for the more ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſie reception of it, I ſhall here adde the <hi>votes</hi> of ſome, whom the <hi>contrary</hi> minded (at leaſt the moſt <hi>pious</hi> of them) will not gainſay. I ſhall not mention the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and practice of the worthy <hi>Miniſters and Martyrs</hi> in <hi>Queen Maries</hi> dayes; ſome of whom were put to death for approving, and uſing <hi>the form</hi> which was then extant, being one of the<note n="(a)" place="margin">Ralph Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerton, John Rough.</note> 
                  <hi>Articles</hi> put in againſt them. Of theſe it will be ſaid, they walked <hi>according to the light then given them;</hi> I ſhall therefore trouble the <hi>Reader</hi> onely with a few teſtimonies of godly and emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent
<pb n="317" facs="tcp:170368:167"/> men, who lived within our own memory; ſome of them rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned among the <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> or old <hi>Puritanes,</hi> yet in this par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular fully concurring with the <hi>Primate.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Mr. <hi>Richard Rogers</hi> Preacher at <hi>Walbersfield</hi> in <hi>Eſſex,</hi> (whom I well remember, and have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten <hi>ſeen</hi> his conſtant attendance at the <hi>publick prayers</hi> of the Church) In his pious book entitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led <hi>the ſeven Treatiſes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In that Chapt. <hi>of publick pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers.</hi> He thus beginneth. <hi>If that mind be in us, with the which we have been taught to come to all ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly exerciſes, and ſo to be prepared for them; who doubteth, but that we may receive much help by them? yea, and the better a man is, the more he ſhall profit by them, &amp;c. Some have thought all ſet forms of
<pb n="318" facs="tcp:170368:168"/> prayer are to be diſliked, and ſuch onely to be offered up to God, as by extemporary gift, are concei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and uttered; And that the Miniſter ſhould uſe no ſet form of prayer, but as they are moved by Gods ſpirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I anſwer. <hi>It is a foul errour ſo to think. For as there be neceſſary things to be prayed for of all men, and alwayes, and thoſe are the moſt things which we are to pray to the Lord for, ſo there may be a preſcript form of prayer made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning all ſuch things; which being ſo, what letteth that in the reading of ſuch forms, either of confeſſing of ſinnes, requeſt, or thanksgiving; what letteth, I ſay, that the hearers hearts may not profitably go on with the ſame, both to humble, to quicken and to comfort: For is the reading it ſelf
<pb n="319" facs="tcp:170368:168"/> unpure, when the Miniſter in his own behalf, and the peoples, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth them to God; I ſpeak not (ye ſee) of the matter of prayer, but of reading it, for if the matter be erro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neus, and naught, the pronounceing of it, maketh it not good, any more then the reading doth; and if it be good and pure being uttered or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, the reading cannot hurt it, or make it evill. And as the Church in the Scripture did, and doth ſing Pſalmes upon a book to God, and yet, though it utter a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript form of words, I hope none will ſay that it is a ſin to do ſo, the heart being prepared. In like manner to follow a preſcript form of words in praying is no ſinne, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ought not to be offenſive to any, &amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>And further, they may know that in all Churches, and the beſt
<pb n="320" facs="tcp:170368:169"/> reformed, there is a preſcript form of prayer uſed, and therefore they who are of mind that it ought not to be, muſt ſeperate themſelves from all Churches. Alſo, if a ſet form of prayer were unlawful, then neither were the Lords prayer (which is a form of prayer, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by our Saviour, himſelf) to be uſed.</hi> And ſo he proceeds to perſwade all good Chriſtians <hi>to lay aſide contention, and endleſſe, and needleſſe queſtions about this matter, and with well order'd hearts and minds to attend unto, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to themſelves the prayers, which either before Sermon or af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Sermon are uttered, or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, which through the whole acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Gods worſhip, are read in their hearing,</hi> &amp;c. So much Mr. <hi>Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now this book of the <hi>ſeven
<pb n="321" facs="tcp:170368:169"/> Treatiſes,</hi> hath been ſince epito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mized by Mr. <hi>Egerton,</hi> and enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled the <hi>practice of Chriſtianitie,</hi> which hath an Epiſtle of Doctor <hi>Gouge</hi> before it, in a high com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of it. Now, at the concluſion of that he hath added, <hi>Certain Advertiſements concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing prayer,</hi> in which, his, or both their judgements in this ſubject, are declared accordingly. viz. <hi>That it is lawfull, and in ſome ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes expedient, to uſe a ſet form of prayer. Queſtion</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>is made by many of the lawfulneſſe, or at leaſt of the expediencie of praying by the help of a book, or of uſing a preſcript, and ſet form of prayer. It is to be conſidered, that there be divers degrees and mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of gifts, both naturall, as of grace; beſides, ſome have been by cuſtome more trained and exerciſed
<pb n="222" facs="tcp:170368:170"/> in this holy dutie then others, &amp;c. which difference I have obſerved, not onely in private Chriſtians, but alſo in ſome moſt reverend, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, and worthy Miniſters. Some uſing both in their publick Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterie, and in their private fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; a ſtinted prayer, and ſet form of words, with little altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at all, except ſome extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narie occaſion have happened, and yet both ſorts ſo furniſhed with pietie and learning, as I could hardly prefer the one before the other.</hi>

                  <hi>Moreover, whereas in reſpect of the place and company, there be three ſorts of prayer publick in the Church, private in the family, and ſecret by a man ſelf; greateſt li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty may be taken in ſecret and ſolitarie prayer, becauſe we are ſure (that if there be a believe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,
<pb n="323" facs="tcp:170368:170"/> humble, upright heart) God will not upbraid any man for his method, order, words, or utterance. Yet in private prayer we may not take ſo great a libertie,</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Leſſe liberty in private prayer.</note> 
                  <hi>&amp;c. and ſome well-affected, have been ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what faultie and offenſive in this behalfe: weak and tender Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, (ſuch as commonly are in a family) are not ſo capable of that kind of prayer, which is called, conceived, or extemporate, vary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every time in words and phra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, manner, and order, though the matter and ſubſtance be the ſame.</hi>
                  <note place="margin">Leaſt liberty in publick prayer.</note> 
                  <hi>But eſpecially care muſt be had in the publick congregation, that nothing be done in praying, preaching, or Adminiſtration of Sacraments, but that which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and orderly; becauſe there, many eyes do ſee us, and many ears do hear us; and therefore it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient
<pb n="324" facs="tcp:170368:171"/> (for the moſt part) to keep a conſtant form, both of mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and words, and yet without ſervile tying our ſelves to words and ſyllables, but uſing herein ſuch libertie and freedome, as may ſtand with comelineſſe, &amp;c.</hi> And ſo he proceeds thus to direct men, that though a <hi>Book may be uſed in private prayer, yet that it is much better to get their prayer by heart, commending the uſe of the Lords Prayer, and the varietie of other formes of godly prayers in print, penned by forreigne Divines, as our own countreymen; as Mr.</hi> Brad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford <hi>that bleſſed Martyr, Maſter</hi> Deering, <hi>Mr.</hi> Hieron, and divers others yet living, <hi>whoſe printed prayers are nothing inferiour to the former.</hi> And ſo becauſe <hi>there ever have been, and ſtill are many Babes in the Church of God, which
<pb n="325" facs="tcp:170368:171"/> have need of milk, &amp;c. and ſome of bad memories, and heavie ſpirits, &amp;c. he frames divers formes of prayers to be uſed for Morning and Evening in caſe of ſickneſſe, for the Lords day,</hi> &amp;c. Thus much very excellently, Mr. <hi>Egerton,</hi> approved by Doctor <hi>Gouge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Mr.</hi> Arthur Hilderſham, Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher at <hi>Aſhbie-delazouch</hi> in <hi>Lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter-ſhire,</hi> upon the 51 Pſalme, p. 63. ſaith thus. <hi>I dare not deny, but a weak Chriſtian may uſe the help of a good Prayer-book; better to pray on a book, then not to pray at all. Certainly 'tis a ſpirit of errour, that hath taught the world otherwiſe.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Firſt, our bleſſed Saviour pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed to his Diſciples a Forme of prayer, not only to be to them and his whole Church a rule, and ſampler, according to which, all
<pb n="326" facs="tcp:170368:172"/> our prayers ſhould be framed, (as appears, when he ſaith,</hi> Matth. 6.9. <hi>After this manner pray ye,) but even for them; to ſay, tying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the very words of it, as appeareth,</hi> Luke 11.2. <hi>when ye pray, ſay, our Father, &amp;c. By which anſwer of our Saviour to his Diſciples, it may alſo appear, that</hi> John <hi>taught his diſciples to pray, by giving them forms of prayer; to ſay, yea, even in ſecret prayer.</hi> Matth. 6.6.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>All the beſt reformed Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches do now, and ever have uſed, even in publick Liturgies, preſcript forms of prayer; and have judged them of great uſe and neceſſitie for the edification of the Church: And ſurely this argument is not to be contemned by any ſober Chriſtian, as appeareth by the Apoſtles ſpeech,</hi> 1 Cor. 11.16. <hi>If any man ſeem to
<pb n="327" facs="tcp:170368:172"/> be contentious, we have no ſuch cuſtome; neither the Churches of God: So doth he again preſſe the example and practice of all the Churches of the Saints,</hi> 1 Cor. 14.33.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>This is no ſtinting, nor hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derance to the ſpirit of Prayer in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of Gods people, no more then the ſinging of praiſe to the Lord in the words of</hi> David, <hi>is now, and was in</hi> Hezekiahs <hi>time,</hi> 2 Chron. 29.30. <hi>or the joining in heart with the words that another uttereth in conceived prayer: Thus far</hi> Mr. Hilderſham.</p>
               <p>Doctor <hi>Preſton</hi> (who uſed a ſet Form of Prayer before Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon) in that Sermon of his prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched before <hi>King James,</hi> Text, <hi>John</hi> 1.16. <hi>Of his fulneſſe we have all received,</hi> &amp;c. p. 22. ſaith thus. <hi>That a ſet form is lawfull, much
<pb n="328" facs="tcp:170368:173"/> need not be ſaid, the very newneſſe of the contrary opinion is enough to ſhew the vanitie and falſhood of it. It is contrary to the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved judgement of approved Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cells, learned Fathers, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual practice of the Church.</hi> He inſtanceth in <hi>Tertullians time,</hi> and <hi>Origen,</hi> Saint <hi>Baſil, Ambroſe.

                  <hi>How ſlight is that which is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected againſt the lawfulneſſe of it; to wit, That the ſpirit is ſtinted, when we are fetterd with words appointed?</hi>
               </p>
               <pb n="329" facs="tcp:170368:173"/>
               <p>I anſwer, <hi>The freedome of the ſpirit ſtands not ſo much in the extent of words, as in the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of zeal, wherein they are ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. And if a ſet form be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full, then muſt a ſet form needs excell, which is dictated by Chriſt himſelf, and is therefore more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to be uſed, and with all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verence, both in mind and geſture; nor doth this want the practice and approbation of the Antienteſt,</hi> inſtancing in Saint <hi>Cyprian,</hi> and Saint <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And for a further confirmati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſee the ſame affirmed by him again, in his book called the <hi>Saints daily exerciſe,</hi> ſet forth and approved by Doctor <hi>Sibbs,</hi> (who himſelf uſed a ſet Form of Prayer before Sermon,) Mr. <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venport</hi> p. 80. viz. <hi>Another caſe</hi> (ſaith he) is, <hi>Whether we may
<pb n="330" facs="tcp:170368:174"/> uſe a ſet Forme of Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Anſw. <hi>I need not ſay much to you, for I think there is none here that doubts, but that a ſet Form of Prayer may be uſed: you know Chriſt preſcribed a Form; you know there were certain Pſalmes, that were prayers that were uſed conſtantly, and therefore no doubt, but a ſet Form may be uſed, and in the Church at all times, both in Primitive times, and all along to the beginning of the Reformed times, to</hi> Luther, <hi>and</hi> Calvins <hi>time, ſtill in all times, the Church had ſet Forms they uſed, and I know no ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection is of weight. One main obje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction is this.</hi> That in ſtinted pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, the ſpirit is ſtreitned, &amp;c. To this he gives a threefold anſwer.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>They that object it, do the ſame thing daily in the congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, whoſe ſpirits are limited and
<pb n="331" facs="tcp:170368:174"/> ſtinted by being hearers of him that prayes.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>'Tis no generall tye, but at other times in private, they may be as free as they will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>The ſpirit or affections are not tyed, or reſtrained hy a ſet form, there may be largeneſſe of the heart, though there be a limit of words;</hi> This is the ſumme of the anſwer, which the Reader may have more at large there.</p>
               <p>And thus I have given ye the judgement of theſe four <hi>eminent</hi> men in their time, approved by three other equall with them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, all fully concurring with the <hi>Primate</hi> in this particular, which cannot but prevail much with ſuch as have been, or are otherwiſe minded at this day, I adde no more, preſuming that thoſe that will deſpiſe theſe, will
<pb n="332" facs="tcp:170368:175"/> ſet light by any other; and ſo much for this ſubject, <hi>concerning a ſet Form of Prayer.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now there are <hi>two</hi> other things, which upon this occaſion might not be unſeaſonable to ſpeak a word of, according to the <hi>Primates</hi> judgement alſo. viz. <hi>Of the length</hi> or <hi>brevity</hi> in prayer, and of the <hi>Geſture</hi> at it; in both which, many of this age have gone aſtray.</p>
               <p n="1">1. For the <hi>length.</hi> In the publick, all good diſcretion teacheth <hi>ordinarily</hi> not to be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry large, (for we ſpeak not now of <hi>extraordinary</hi> duties in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Faſts) becauſe in a congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, all the Auditours are not of the like <hi>ſtrength.</hi> Some, (ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to that diſtinction of <hi>John</hi> 1. <hi>Ep.</hi> 2.13, 14.) may be <hi>Fathers,</hi> ſome <hi>young men,</hi> but
<pb n="333" facs="tcp:170368:175"/> others <hi>Children</hi> fitter for <hi>milke then ſtrong meat,</hi> that a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance at prayer may as ill ſuit with them, as putting of a <hi>new garment to an old,</hi> or <hi>new wine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to old bottles.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Jacobs</hi> ſpeech in anſwer to his Brother <hi>Eſau,</hi> when he would have had him driven on his pace with him (<hi>Gen.</hi> 33.13.) <hi>I will</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>lead on ſoftly according as the Cattle with young, which are with me, and the children which are tender ſhall be able to endure, leſt if I ſhould over-drive them one day, the flock ſhould die,</hi> may have its Morall applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the prudence of a Paſtor this way.</p>
               <p>'Tis very dangerous to cauſe a <hi>fulneſſe</hi> in the worſhip of God, that for prayer men ſhould be apt to ſay, as thoſe in the <hi>Prophet</hi>
                  <pb n="334" facs="tcp:170368:176"/> for the <hi>Sabbath, when will it be done?</hi>

               </p>
               <p>There is an excellent Epiſtle of Saint <hi>Auguſtines</hi> concerning this ſubject, (<hi>Epiſt.</hi> 121. <hi>Probae vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duae.</hi>) that (ſaith he) <hi>is not a commendation that he was long at prayer;</hi> there may be <hi>much ſpeech, but little praying (multa loquutio non multa precatio)</hi> while the affection is lifted up; like the <hi>hands of Moſes,</hi> ſo long the party prayes, when that <hi>is heavie,</hi> the Act of prayer ceaſeth; ſometimes
<pb n="335" facs="tcp:170368:176"/> (ſaith he) <hi>the work of prayer is rather done (gemitibus quàm ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monibus; fletu quàm afflatu) with ſighes, then words, teares, then lips.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The time when our <hi>Saviour</hi> is obſerved to have uſed a <hi>prolixity,</hi> was in the <hi>private,</hi> then <hi>whole nights</hi> in prayer, and <hi>the whole day till even,</hi> but not in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick; reſpecting, it may be, the cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes before mentioned.

               <p>Secondly, for the <hi>geſture;</hi> Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly, the moſt comely is <hi>kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> after the example of <hi>David,</hi> (Pſal. 100. <hi>Ezra (cap.</hi> 9.5.) <hi>Daniel (cap.</hi> 6.10.) and the pattern of our <hi>Saviour,</hi> Luc. 22.41. <hi>he kneeled down and prayed,</hi> &amp;c. whoſe example Saint <hi>Stephen</hi> followed, (<hi>Acts</hi> 7.6.) and Saint <hi>Paul (Acts</hi> 20.36.) <hi>For this cauſe I bow my

               <p>Nay, <hi>ſtanding</hi> is not ſo ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly limited, but 'tis ſometimes taken for <hi>kneeling,</hi> (2 Chron. 6.12.)

               <p>Now for the better reception of this latter part of the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates</hi> judgement, concerning our <hi>outward reverence</hi> in the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick worſhip of God, whether at <hi>hearing of the Word</hi> or <hi>Prayer;</hi> ſo much neglected in theſe times; I ſhall here adde what I find in the foreſaid Mr. <hi>Arthur Hilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſham,</hi> in his <hi>Lectures</hi> upon <hi>John</hi> 4. In the 26. Lecture he ſpeakes much for the <hi>outward reverence of Gods publick worſhip in the Church.</hi> viz. <hi>That we ſhould neither come into that place, nor go out of
<pb n="342" facs="tcp:170368:180"/> it, as ye would in or out of a dance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-ſchoole; But in our very come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in, and going out, and whole out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward carriage; we ſhould give ſome ſignification of the reverence that we bear to this place, and that we do indeed account it the houſe of God; Exhorts men to come to the beginning of the then publick worſhip, or before it begins; and tarry till all be done:</hi> to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent at the <hi>Adminiſtration of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſme, and at the bleſſing pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by Gods Miniſters. Affirmes, that there was nothing then done in Gods publick worſhip among us, but it was done by the Inſtitution, and Ordinance, and Commandement of the Lord;</hi> the particulars of which, he men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>In his 27. Lecture, he exhorts to <hi>a reverend geſture in prayer,
<pb n="343" facs="tcp:170368:180"/> kneeling as the fitteſt; or ſtanding,</hi> not <hi>ſitting.</hi> And commending the reading of the Scriptures in publick; he ſaith, <hi>At the hearing of the word read, ſome further ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture, and outward ſignification of reverence is to be uſed, then is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired at the hearing of the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon;</hi> which he confirmes by proofes out of Scripture and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, too large to be related here. But he thus concludes. <hi>viz. So you ſee the cuſtome of our Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches in ſitting bare while the Word is read, is grounded upon good reaſon and warrant from the word of God, and ſuch, as it well becomes every one of Gods peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to conform themſelves unto.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Lect. 29. he complains of that irreverence thus. <hi>Some will not vouchſafe to be bare at the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word, ſome will be bare
<pb n="344" facs="tcp:170368:181"/> at the Pſalmes, not at the Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; and if they could juſtly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend infirmity for it, they were to be excuſed; but they will not be bare many of them, ſo long as the Text is in reading: yea, every youth and boy in our Congregations, are wont to be covered, while the Word is read.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>But the chief abuſe is, the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect of kneeling in prayer, many that will kneel at their own private prayers (which they make at their coming into the Church) can never be ſeen to kneel at the common and publick prayers. Many that will kneel at the Lords prayer, will kneel at no other, wherein (though the Lords prayer be in ſundry re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects more excellent then any other yet) there is as much reaſon we ſhould kneel at any other prayer, as at it; for the reaſon of our
<pb n="345" facs="tcp:170368:181"/> kneeling, is not the excellency of the words uſed in prayer, but the reverence and duty we owe to the perſon we pray unto,</hi> &amp;c. This ſaith that <hi>worthy and judicious Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> Mr. <hi>Hilderſham,</hi>) I can but wonder, upon what pretence ſuch a man could be ſilenced, (as he wrot himſelfe to the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; Anno</hi> 1630.</p>
               <p>I conclude only with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hortation to <hi>decency, and a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent comelineſſe</hi> in our ſolemne meetings, that devotion and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence may <hi>kiſſe</hi> each other, that while the ſoule is <hi>lifted up</hi> in prayer, the body may be <hi>hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled,</hi> and the whole man <hi>preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> to God as an <hi>acceptable ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice,</hi> that <hi>unity</hi> and <hi>uniformity</hi> in <hi>doctrine</hi> and <hi>worſhip;</hi> may be found among us, and that we may all be of <hi>one heart,</hi> and <hi>one

               <head>A CHARACTER of Biſhop <hi>Bedell</hi> late Biſhop of <hi>Kilmore,</hi> in <hi>Ireland.</hi>
               </head>
               <p>UPon the occaſion of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing this <hi>Sermon</hi> of his (on <hi>Revel.</hi> 18.4.) I have thought fit to give this <hi>exemplary character</hi> of him. Somewhat of his life is already extant, within that of Sir <hi>Henry Wottons,</hi> the enlargement of which, I leave to the prudence of others, onely thus much in brief.</p>
               <p>He was <hi>Fellow of Emmanuel Colledge in Cambridge,</hi> where he was one of the <hi>eight</hi> that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced <hi>Batchellours of Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity</hi>
                  <pb n="348" facs="tcp:170368:183"/> of that houſe in one yeare: whereof <hi>Biſhop Hall</hi> and <hi>Doctor Ward</hi> were two, between whom and him, there was a continuall intercourſe of Letters to their laſt. From that <hi>Colledge</hi> and <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity,</hi> he had that <hi>Character</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven him of learning, and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that he was choſen to go with the <hi>Embaſſadour Sir</hi> Henry Wotton <hi>unto Venice.</hi> What the fruits of his ſome yeares being there produced upon <hi>Padre Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo,</hi> and other learned men, ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently appears by the teſtimony given of him in a letter of the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors</hi> hereunto annexed. The <hi>Interdict of Venice</hi> (wrot by the foreſaid Authour,) he tranſlated out of <hi>Italian</hi> into <hi>Latin,</hi> for whoſe uſe he alſo tranſlated the book of <hi>Common Prayer</hi> into Ita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian, and made an <hi>Engliſh Gram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mar</hi>
                  <pb n="349" facs="tcp:170368:183"/> (which I have ſeen writ with his own hand.)</p>
               <p>After his return from <hi>Venice,</hi> were wrot thoſe learned <hi>Letters</hi> of his to Mr. <hi>Wadeſworth,</hi> who at the ſame time, going with the <hi>Embaſſadour into Spain,</hi> had been withdrawn to the <hi>See</hi> of <hi>Rome,</hi> whoſe temper and meekneſſe of ſtile to an <hi>Apoſtate,</hi> I wiſh were ſo far exemplary with ſome Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters among our ſelves, as to abate that <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>bitterneſſe,</hi> which hath broke forth in matters of leſſe conſequence.</p>
               <p>At his Benefice of <hi>Horningeſh-earth</hi> near St. <hi>Edm. Bury</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> he continued long in great eſteem, ſometimes choſen by the Dioceſſe to be a member of the <hi>Convocation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Upon the death of Sir <hi>William Temple</hi> Provoſt of the Colledge in <hi>Dublin,</hi> the late <hi>Primate</hi> wrot ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly
<pb n="350" facs="tcp:170368:184"/> to him to accept of it, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unanimouſly choſen by the <hi>Fellowes.</hi> During his abode there, he performed the duty of the <hi>Cate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiſt,</hi> &amp; preached a Lecture Sermon once a week in Chriſt Church.</p>
               <p>He was not long <hi>Provoſt,</hi> but he was promoted to be <hi>Biſhop</hi> of <hi>Kilmore,</hi> where (I being then the <hi>Dean</hi>) it gave me the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to be more known to him.</p>
               <p>In relation to the <hi>Liturgie</hi> of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> he gave this direction; <hi>viz.</hi> to obſerve whatſoever was enjoyned in the <hi>Rubrick</hi> without <hi>addition</hi> or <hi>di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minution;</hi> not to be led by <hi>cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtome,</hi> but by <hi>rule.</hi> And in ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciall, he ordered that the whole <hi>Doxology</hi> to the bleſſed <hi>Trinity, Glory be to the Father,</hi> &amp;c. ſhould be alwayes read by the <hi>Miniſter alone,</hi> without the <hi>reſpond</hi> of the
<pb n="351" facs="tcp:170368:184"/> people, and the like for the <hi>Pſalms: Te Deum,</hi> &amp;c. with the reſt, appointed to be read be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween and after the <hi>Leſſons,</hi> though the cuſtome had prevai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led otherwiſe in moſt Churches.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Communion Table</hi> was pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by him, not at the <hi>Eaſt</hi> end, but within the <hi>body</hi> of the <hi>Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell,</hi> and for other <hi>Innovations</hi> elſewhere introduced, he obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them not. His judgement being, that thoſe were as well <hi>Non-conformiſts,</hi> who <hi>added</hi> of their own, as thoſe who came <hi>ſhort</hi> of what was enjoyned, as he that <hi>addes</hi> an inch to the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, diſownes it for a <hi>rule,</hi> as well as he that cuts an inch <hi>off.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was a careful obſerver of the <hi>Lords Day</hi> both in the <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>private,</hi> at one of the clock in the after-noon; he had then
<pb n="352" facs="tcp:170368:185"/> the Book of <hi>Common-Prayer</hi> read in the <hi>Iriſh</hi> tongue in the Church for the benefit of the <hi>Iriſh;</hi> at which he was conſtantly preſent himſelf, who in that little ſpace had obtained the <hi>knowledge</hi> of the language. And as the <hi>New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> had been long before tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlated into <hi>Iriſh;</hi> ſo had he cauſed the <hi>Old Teſtam.</hi> to be accordingly, &amp; was almoſt ready for the preſs.</p>
               <p>And Whereas Doctor <hi>Heylene</hi> hath cenſured the late <hi>Primate</hi> very liberally for his approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Articles of Ireland,</hi> he muſt take <hi>Biſhop Bedell</hi> into the number alſo, who was ſo much for them, that I was preſent when, at the examination of an<note n="*" place="margin">Mr. <hi>Thomas Price</hi> then Fellow of the Colledge of <hi>Dublin,</hi> who afterwards ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered much in the ſame Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſe by the Rebellion of <hi>I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="353" facs="tcp:170368:185"/> for that end, at leaſt 2 full hours, whereby our <hi>votes</hi> might be alſo given for his approbation.</p>
               <p>At his <hi>Courts of Juriſdiction,</hi> he frequently ſate himſelf; where he cauſed alwayes ſome of the <hi>Clergy,</hi> (if any were there) to ſit covered on each ſide of him, with <hi>liberty</hi> to give their opinion in each caſe, and at a <hi>ſentence,</hi> he asked their votes man by man: In ſome degree reducing then his <hi>Epiſcopall</hi> to a <hi>Synodicall Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> according to the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates</hi> propoſall by way of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodation <hi>an.</hi> 1641.

               <p>At the <hi>Viſitations,</hi> he uſually preached himſelfe. The <hi>Procura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> were beſtowed in defraying
<pb n="354" facs="tcp:170368:186"/> the charges of the Miniſters, and the reſt given to ſome pious uſes.</p>
               <p>After <hi>dinner</hi> and <hi>ſupper,</hi> a <hi>Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,</hi> was conſtantly read at his Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and ſome time ſpent by him in opening ſome difficulties in it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>publick Catechiſme,</hi> he had branched out into 52 parts; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of, he appointed one to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly explain'd in the <hi>Afternoons</hi> in each Church, within his Dioceſs.</p>
               <p>He was very indulgent to the <hi>Iriſh</hi> Natives, in the preferring and encouraging of them for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery; and yet ſuch was their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude</hi> (i. e. the Popiſh party) that in that horrid <hi>rebellion,</hi> 1641. they exempted him not from their rapine; but ſeized upon his <hi>cattle,</hi> pillaged his <hi>houſe,</hi> ransack't and ſpoyled his <hi>Library;</hi> put him into a <hi>Caſtle,</hi> ſtanding in a <hi>Lough,</hi> (called <hi>Lough-outre</hi>) about a mile and a halfe from his houſe,
<pb n="355" facs="tcp:170368:186"/> where he was <hi>impriſoned</hi> that winter. And at length being per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to come out, died in a poor houſe of one who was an <hi>Iriſh-man,</hi> and a <hi>Proteſtant,</hi> and continued faithfull to him; by whoſe means an <hi>Hebrew manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcript Bible</hi> of his, (which he brought from <hi>Venice</hi>) was preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and is now in <hi>Emmanuel</hi> Colledge Library in <hi>Cambridge.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>He was <hi>buried</hi> acccording to his own <hi>appointment</hi> in the Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard of the Cathedral of <hi>Kilmore,</hi> where he had cauſed his <hi>wife</hi> and <hi>ſon</hi> ſome years before to be buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. His judgement being againſt burials in Churches, as an <hi>abuſe</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced by pride &amp; ſuperſtition.</p>
               <p>I conclude only with this, if the <hi>Moderation</hi> of this <hi>Biſhop</hi> had been obſerved elſewhere. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> might have been kept <hi>upon its wheeles.</hi>

               <p>Mr. <hi>Thomas Pierce</hi> hath in an <hi>Appendage</hi> to a late book of his, printed <hi>five Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> wrot unto me by him, in each of which I cannot but much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his <hi>reſpects</hi> to me. To the <hi>four</hi> firſt I gave little elſe but brief returnes of the like to him, which conſiſting <hi>chiefly,</hi> ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the aſſerting of the <hi>near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe</hi> of his judgement to the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates,</hi> or the <hi>remoteneſſe</hi> of Mr. <hi>Barlees,</hi> I did not conceive it fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for me to interpoſe, and where there was a profeſſed <hi>full agreement,</hi> it was no good office
<pb n="360" facs="tcp:170368:189"/> in me to make a <hi>difference.</hi> Now for thoſe, the cauſe rendred of his not publiſhing them is good, there being <hi>nothing</hi> (as he ſaith) <hi>needfull, or of concernment, in any one of them,</hi> Only to the <hi>fifth</hi> of his, wherein <hi>three Certificates</hi> are publiſhed as teſtimonies to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm his former aſſertion of a <hi>late change of judgment in the Primate,</hi> with other applicatory paſſages from thence, I did return him a <hi>larger</hi> anſwer in this <hi>Letter</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, (excepting ſome few <hi>cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtantiall</hi> alterations) having then no imagination that <hi>either</hi> of them ſhould have bin made pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick. And I have as little mind to it now, only by the <hi>provocation</hi> of divers of my Friends who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the <hi>Primate</hi> ſuffers in the interpretation of many by the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of it, I have been compel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led
<pb n="361" facs="tcp:170368:189"/> upon this occaſion, to put forth this brief <hi>defence</hi> of him without any <hi>offence</hi> to Mr. <hi>Pierce.</hi> For his <hi>Appendage</hi> (wherein his reſpects to me are rather encrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed then leſſened) I have thought fit to clear <hi>one paſſage.</hi> He ſaith I have ſpoken <hi>indiſcriminately</hi> of Univerſal <hi>Grace,</hi> and Vniverſall <hi>Redemption,</hi> and the place he quotes for it, is out of my ſecond Letter to Mr. <hi>Barlee,</hi> p. 64. in theſe words, viz. <hi>But that by an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall Redemption ſhould be underſtood, an <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſall Grace, &amp;c. will not be atteſted to have heen affirmed by the Primate,</hi> &amp;c. doth not this clearly imply a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinction to be made between them; I am ſure I then ſo inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it. And therefore that which he addes immediately after. <hi>viz. That there is a wide difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="362" facs="tcp:170368:190"/> them, I</hi> do fully concurre with him in it. Yet it ſeems to me, that himſelf puts them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther often <hi>indiſcriminately,</hi> as in the page before this, thrice in one page, 86. and p. 88. l. 32. as in his <hi>Philanth.</hi> p. 15. and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. And if I have in any other place done it, as in the title of the Letter, I was led to it by him.

                        <salute>SIR,</salute>
                     </opener>
                     <p>I Owe you many thanks for the labour you have taken in your laſt Letter of the 28. of <hi>January,</hi> in tranſcribing the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates of thoſe learned perſons, which (ſuppoſing to have been rightly apprehended by them, without any miſtake of him, yet) favourably interpreted, do not ſeem to me neceſſarily to ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue what you have apprehended, and concluded of the change of judgement in the <hi>Primate,</hi> which I ſhall now ingenuouſly give
<pb n="364" facs="tcp:170368:191"/> you my ſenſe of, without any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of further diſpute or conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about it.</p>
                     <p>Firſt for Doctor <hi>Waltons,</hi> where he ſaith, <hi>My Lord Primate did declare his utter diſlike of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine of abſolute reprobation;</hi> I conceive it may be underſtood of the <hi>Supralapſarian</hi> opinion, which makes reprobation to be antecedent to the fall of <hi>Adam,</hi> and not only as a <hi>Praeterition,</hi> but a <hi>Predamnation</hi> for actuall ſins. <hi>That he held the univerſality of Chriſts death, not onely in reſpect of ſufficiency, but alſo in regard of efficacy, ſo that all men were by that made ſalvable</hi> (for ſo much <hi>efficacy</hi> I do not deny) differs not from that which his letter publiſhed, doth teſtifie,) <hi>and that the reaſon why all men were not thereby ſaved, was becauſe they
<pb n="365" facs="tcp:170368:191"/> did not accept of ſalvation offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> is alſo granted, if it be accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his judgement rightly underſtood, <hi>viz.</hi> of thoſe to whom the Goſpel is preached; not of Pagans, and Infidels.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>That the grace of Converſion was not irreſiſtable, but that men did often reſiſt and reject the ſame,</hi> may well ſtand with my Lord <hi>Primates</hi> Judgement, and no wayes oppoſite to this. <hi>viz.</hi> That it is ſo effectual, that by the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cree of his election; It is not <hi>reſiſted</hi> by the elect, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>his diſſent from Geneva</hi> (as Doctor <hi>Walton</hi> certifies) is to be underſtood of <hi>Beza,</hi> not of <hi>Cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin;</hi> nor of the <hi>Sublapſarian</hi> (as I have intimated before) and I conceive his <hi>concurrence with Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop Overall,</hi> which he averreth him to have profeſſed, is to be
<pb n="366" facs="tcp:170368:192"/> underſtood as I have expreſſed it: for you know that <hi>Biſhop Overall</hi> diſtinguiſhed the <hi>Remonſtrants</hi> opinion, and that which he is pleaſed to call the opinion of the <hi>Puritans;</hi> (which title I wiſh he had ſpared) from the doctrine of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> which joynes the univerſality of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption with the ſpeciall inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of God, effectually to ſave the elect. This for Doctor <hi>Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons</hi> Certificate.</p>
                     <p>Now for Mr. <hi>Goninges,</hi> which ſeems (by the Preface of it) to have bin given you after your publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Lord <hi>Primates</hi> change of judgment; ſomewhat of that may be ſafely granted; <hi>viz. The ſinceri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Gods univerſal call of all ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to whom the Goſpel was prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched,</hi> which is the ſumme of what he affirmes to have heard,
<pb n="367" facs="tcp:170368:192"/> from him in the publick, but for that which he ſaith he received from him in private, <hi>viz. That God, together with his word prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ched, did give internal grace to all that are called by it, that they may repent if they will, yea they all can will, &amp;c.</hi> If the <hi>Primates</hi> words were not miſtaken by him, (as they might the more poſſibly by the diſtance between the hearing, and the date of his cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificate to you) I ſuppoſe this was the ſenſe of them, <hi>viz.</hi> That by <hi>internall</hi> grace he did not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand more, then that there are ſome <hi>good motions</hi> offered unto the <hi>hearts</hi> of ſinners, which if they did not <hi>extinguiſh</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt,</hi> and thereby draw up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves a <hi>further guilt,</hi> they ſhould be <hi>ſeconded</hi> with more <hi>effectuall</hi> grace; and, that
<pb n="368" facs="tcp:170368:193"/> upon their diſobedience, God doth <hi>juſtly</hi> leave them to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and doth not ſuperadde that <hi>ſpeciall grace,</hi> whereby their <hi>Wills</hi> are <hi>changed,</hi> and their <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion</hi> wrought. As for <hi>poſſe non reſiſtere,</hi> it is conſiſtent with actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>all <hi>reſiſtance,</hi> which is taken away by ſpeciall grace, and thus far I conceive he might hold with <hi>Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop Overall;</hi> ſo much for Mr. <hi>Goninge.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For Mr. <hi>Thornedicks</hi> Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, I ſee not wherein it differeth from the Lord <hi>Primates</hi> Letter publiſhed, and needs no further anſwer. So that upon the whole I do not find, even by theſe Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificates, ſo ſure a ground, for your aſſertion of my Lord <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates change of judgement,</hi> and his <hi>being of late a ſerious convert, &amp;c.</hi> as you have ſuppoſed; The firſt
<pb n="369" facs="tcp:170368:193"/> pretend but little, the laſt leſs, and the middle not much; thus inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preted: Howſoever for <hi>my ſelf,</hi> had I been an ear-witneſſe of that which certifies the moſt <hi>largely,</hi> I ſhould have had more <hi>caution</hi> then to have adventured to ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fie the judgement of ſo <hi>eminent</hi> a perſon, <hi>under hand, and ſeale,</hi> (as you ſay you have it) without his knowledge, or conſent, whether when he was <hi>living,</hi> or ſince his <hi>death,</hi> eſpecially in that which ſhould ſeem to <hi>imply a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction,</hi> to what he had before <hi>ſaid</hi> and <hi>wrot.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>For that <hi>Objection</hi> of the 32 Article of <hi>Ireland,</hi> that Article may very well admit of ſome <hi>preparative</hi> motions tending to converſion, but not the actuall grace of converſion; and may alſo be underſtood of denying an <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuall
<pb n="370" facs="tcp:170368:194"/> call</hi> of all men, which are out of the <hi>Pale</hi> of the Church, or that the works of the creation and providence do lead men, or enable them to come to Chriſt, as ſome <hi>French Divines</hi> have lately taught.</p>
                     <p>For that <hi>inconſiſtency</hi> implyed by you, from what I have affirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of my Lord <hi>Primates</hi> judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Maſſa corrupta</hi> was the object of predeſtination, it will well conſiſt with his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of univerſall redemption, expreſſed in his letter. And, the decree of <hi>reprobation,</hi> ſuppoſed to be <hi>ex intentione ſpeciali,</hi> doth not deny a <hi>ſalvability</hi> of all men, but onely an effectuall grace to be given to work their converſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and may alſo conſiſt with univerſall redemption, and poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of ſalvation, becauſe repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
<pb n="371" facs="tcp:170368:194"/> is onely <hi>negatio ſpecialis gratiae, non nudae ſufficientis.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As for <hi>Goteſchalchus,</hi> the <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate</hi> relating the truth of the ſtory, and his opinion, is not thereby obliged to every particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar of them, and if there were any miſtakes of Mr. <hi>Barlees</hi> from thence, or that large <hi>Catechiſme</hi> going under his name, doth not concern me to take notice of:</p>
                     <p>For that which you mention of Mr. <hi>Vaughans</hi> relation in the life, and death of Doctor <hi>Jackson,</hi> of the care which the <hi>Primate</hi> took, (being (as you ſay) a <hi>Mourner</hi> at his funerall) to have his writings <hi>very religiouſly</hi> preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. Firſt, I have viewed the place, and find ſome miſtake in the words, which are onely thus; <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Biſhop of Armagh, (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at his funerall)</hi> much deſired
<pb n="372" facs="tcp:170368:195"/> his papers might be <hi>carefully</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. But ſecondly, I do not believe the <hi>Primate</hi> meant, or approved thoſe works of Doctor <hi>Jacksons,</hi> wherein he profeſſeth himſelf to be for the <hi>Arminian</hi> way, as he doth in the Epiſtle Dedicatory of thoſe Bookes which he dedicated to the <hi>Earle of Pembrook,</hi> and which were anſwered by Doctor <hi>Twiſſe.</hi> O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther works it may be, that <hi>learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> man might have of other ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, which might be uſefull to poſterity, which the <hi>Primate</hi> might have a care of, but I do not believe they were any of <hi>that nature;</hi> and the rather be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they muſt be meant of ſuch works which were <hi>not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant</hi> at his death, and not of thoſe which were <hi>already</hi> printed, as you ſeem to apply it. Beſides, it
<pb n="373" facs="tcp:170368:195"/> doth not appear, the <hi>Primate</hi> then underſtood what ſubjects they were of; And therefore, that which you have immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately added of your own; <hi>viz. That ſuch ineſtimable</hi> 
                        <gap reason="foreign">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap> 
                        <hi>might not be wanting to poſterity, but might performe their work of bringing religion into its wits,</hi> (which the Reader might poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly miſtake, in apprehending them to have been the <hi>Primates</hi> words) and your ſomewhat ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere application to <hi>him,</hi> from thence, and what Mr. <hi>Barlee</hi> had ſaid of Doctor <hi>Jackson,</hi> ſeemes to want a foundation here.</p>
                     <p>For that which you write in your <hi>Poſtcript</hi> concerning my ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that the doctrine of St. <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine was confirmed,</hi> or inclined unto by the <hi>Primate</hi> in his works, if you obſerve the whole diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe,
<pb n="347" facs="tcp:170368:196"/> it is onely in relation to <hi>Pelagius</hi> and his diſciples, and limited to thoſe points in debate concerning the <hi>Primates</hi> judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereof <hi>univerſall redem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ption and free will,</hi> were mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned; not that by it I had obliged the <hi>Primate</hi> to be of Saint <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtines</hi> judgement in all points be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides: And for that particular of <hi>perſeverance,</hi> which you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance in, it came not into my diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe in either of my Letters to Mr. <hi>Barlee,</hi> what he or Mr. <hi>Baxter</hi> have produced of the <hi>Primates</hi> apprehenſion; what was Saint <hi>Auguſtines</hi> judgement in that point, cannot argue it was therefore his own; In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, Saint <hi>Auguſtine</hi> is vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly conceived in it, in his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verall Tractates, and where he hath ſome expreſſions <hi>tending to
<pb n="375" facs="tcp:170368:196"/> the finall falling away of ſome who have been regenerated and ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtified;</hi> he is thus ſalved by others, who underſtand him either, <hi>de ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtificatis Sacramento tenus,</hi> or <hi>judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cio charitatis,</hi> that they were ſuch, or of ſome <hi>prediſpoſitions</hi> to rege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, in ſome Morall reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; not of a ſpiritual real con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion, which he denies to any reprobate.</p>
                     <p>Now in this variety of ſenſes, you ſhould have done better then thus, to chuſe the worſe; for the <hi>Primates</hi> judgement, who was againſt the <hi>Total and final</hi> falling away of thoſe, who were effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called, truly regenerated and ſanctified, according to the 38 Article of <hi>Ireland;</hi> And thus I have touched the principal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials in your Letter.</p>
                     <p>For that you ſay, <hi>ſome have
<pb n="376" facs="tcp:170368:197"/> endeavoured to gain credit to their Calviniſtical opinions by their unjuſt uſurpation of the</hi> Primates <hi>name.</hi> I could wiſh thoſe hard expreſſions tending ſo much to the diſtaſte of <hi>Calvin,</hi> might be abated; whom divers of the moſt <hi>eminent Writers,</hi> and <hi>learned Fathers</hi> of our Church, (whom I ſuppoſe you reverence) have had in <hi>great eſteem;</hi> and uſually name him with honour.</p>
                     <p>I might quote divers, as Arch-Biſhop <hi>Whitgift,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Bilſon,</hi> Biſhop <hi>Davenant,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hooker,</hi> Doctor <hi>Ward,</hi> &amp;c. but Biſhop <hi>Andrewes</hi> ſhall ſuffice, who in his <hi>determination againſt uſury,</hi> (a caſe wherein he diſſented from <hi>Calvin</hi> yet) thus writes of of him. <hi>Calvino (illuſtri viro nec unquam ſine ſummi honoris prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fatione nominando)</hi> &amp;c. i. e.

                     <p>For that which you <hi>object</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to me, as you did in your third Letter, <hi>viz. my acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgeing</hi> an enngagement to Mr. <hi>Barlee for his readineſſe offered,</hi>

How far he had diſagreed in his book from the <hi>Primates</hi> judgement; I ſhall not now enquire, but after the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of that <hi>tractate,</hi> wherein he read what his was; he wrot thus unto me (<hi>Decemb.</hi> 21. 1657.) viz. <hi>It is true, there be ſome</hi> minutiae, <hi>about which I am not ſatisfied, and ſhall be glad to have an ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable conference with you. However as to the</hi> rei ſummam, <hi>I do ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly agree with the moſt venerable</hi> Primate, <hi>as that I dare diſcharge you from all feares of ever having him expoſed to my pen, and cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, &amp;c.</hi> which I doe the rather
<pb n="379" facs="tcp:170368:198"/> thus punctually repeat his words, becauſe in <hi>ſhort</hi> you have mentio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned it from me in your <hi>fourth Letter.</hi> And when I had <hi>read</hi> you both, meeting in the <hi>Primate,</hi> I thought it my part to ſit down in <hi>ſilence.</hi>

                     <p>In a word, you have with much induſtry viewed, and reviewed the <hi>Primates</hi> judgement in that <hi>point,</hi> which hath been publiſhed, but I wiſh I did not find you ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that uſe of it, to endeavour to confirm <hi>your former aſſertion of a change in him,</hi> in which I am not in the leaſt <hi>ſhaken in mind</hi> by what hath paſſed between us, but muſt ſtill conceive (contrary to your expectation in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of your Letter) there was a <hi>miſtake</hi> whereſoever it lights, which being ſo gentle an expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and which we are all ſubject

                     <p>I ſhall entreat you to let <hi>the venerable name</hi> (as you ſtile it) of that good man reſt in peace, without any further <hi>ſtrife of tongues or pens;</hi> and let us leave his judgment to his works, which do <hi>undoubtedly</hi> teſtifie of him: and for any further diſpute of <hi>this ſubject</hi> between us, I wiſh this might be the <hi>laſt,</hi> as it is the largeſt; and that neither by this, nor any other, the leaſt breach may be made between us, as to love, and friendſhip, which upon all occaſions, ſhall ever ber rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily manifeſted by</p>
